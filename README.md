## Hi there, welcome to my Github profile!

### About Me

I am a passionate programmer and mobile developer. I started my programming journey at the young age of 12, and since then, I have been exploring various programming languages and technologies. Java, in particular, has been a significant part of my journey, as it sparked my interest in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

### My Focus: Mobile Development with Flutter
Currently, I am a Mobile Developer specializing in Flutter. Flutter is a powerful and versatile framework for building native mobile applications for both Android and iOS. I find great joy in creating beautiful and efficient apps that deliver an exceptional user experience.
